<br>Your business will benefit from the confidence and reassurance that your accounts are fully compliant, your accounting processes and procedures are appropriate and that system weaknesses, vulnerabilities and improvements are identified to help reduce business risks.<br>
<br><strong>Statutory Audit<br></strong><br>All entities, including Limited Companies, LLPs and NGOs that meet certain criteria such as exceeding a certain size or being of public interest, or being publicly listed or based on another mandatory provision are required by law to have their financial statements audited at least annually.
<br><br>At Ideasandvisions, we work determinedly to develop a deep understanding of each of our client’s particular needs. This allows us to not just look at the numbers but to explore their implication for our client’s business. Every audit we deliver is bespoke to each client, an approach that allows us to render proactive advice around specific issues they face.<br>
<br><strong>Non Statutory Audits
<br></strong><br>Businesses may require an audit report on financial statements which do not fall under statutory requirements of audit under the Kenya Companies Act.<br><br>Such reports could be on areas such as:
<br><br> <em>Requirements imposed by agreement, such as loan agreements.
<br> Internal controls over financial reporting processes.
<br> Requirements for grants and funding.</em><br></p>

This includes ensuring that all the appropriate deadlines are met and that the maximum amount of tax relief is claimed in accordance with tax legislation.
<br><br>We ensure that all relevant documentation and information is provided timely to the taxing authority i.e., the Kenya Revenue Authority, to minimize exposure to tax enquiries.<br><br><strong>Tax for Individuals
</strong><br>The taxation of individuals in Kenya is inherently complex with greater responsibility imposed on individuals to understand their own tax compliance obligations. <br>Ideasandvisions Solutions is dedicated to assisting individuals with both tax reporting and advising on tax reliefs and other opportunities which includes:
<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;✔ All areas of self-assessment<em><br> </em>✔&nbsp;<em>P</em><em>AYE matters and status reviews
<br> </em>✔&nbsp;<em>T</em><em>ax rules for self-employed 
<br> </em>✔&nbsp;<em>R</em><em>esidency matters and double taxation treaties
<br> </em>✔&nbsp;<em>C</em><em>apital gains tax and applicable reliefs from it, and
<br> </em>✔&nbsp;<em>I</em><em>nheritance tax reporting and estate planning.
</em><br><br><strong>Partnership Taxation
</strong><br>Partners in a firm are taxed on their share of profits from the partnership with each partner effectively taxed as if he or she were self-employed in a business of their own, with profits equal to his or her share of profits from the firm.
<br>Instead of tax being deducted from each partner’s earnings at source, the partner should be prepared to receive a tax bill after filing a partnership tax return. We will therefore provide as much advance information as possible about the likely amount and timing of tax payments due as part of our comprehensive advisory service.
<br><br><strong>Tax for Companies
<br></strong>Corporate tax self-assessment requires companies to compute their tax liability as part of their Income tax obligation and account for the same to the Kenya Revenue Authority. <br>An automatic penalty of Kshs 20,000 will be imposed if the company files its annual return more than 6 months after the end of its financial accounting period.
<br>In absence of a tax return, the authority may determine the tax due to the best of its belief and information available to it. This determination may be disputed only by filing a complete return along with a self-assessment supported by clear and convincing evidence.
<br><br>We will provide you with as much advance information as possible regarding the amount and timing of tax payments due as part of our comprehensive compliance and advisory services.
<br><br><strong>VAT and Custom Duty
<br><br></strong>VAT and Custom Duty are obligations that typically comprises a significant part of most business’s cash flow operations.
<br>With VAT legislation becoming increasingly more restrictive and KRA becoming increasingly aggressive in its approach towards business tax compliance, it is now more important than ever to ensure that your VAT accounts are in order and that you have been able to maximize VAT savings available to you and minimize your VAT cost.
<br>VAT is a complicated tax and the constant changes to the VAT Act requires substantial and comprehensive know-how in order to avert the significant penalties that may arise in failure thereof. <br>VAT is also a transaction -based tax, and thus queries usually demand an expedited response.
<br><br>We have extensive experience in all matters VAT including planning, investigations and general compliance.&nbsp;</p>
